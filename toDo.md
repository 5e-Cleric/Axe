# Stuff to Achieve and how to do so

- [ ] Content labels editable
    i guess i could make a function so that all labels are content editable, although that sounds cheap

    Does it make sense to have textareas and inputs instead of white boxes?

Maybe users could later edit those saved CS and save them...

- [ ] Export to pdf, like the HB does it
- [ ] Save CS to DB
