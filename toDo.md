# Stuff to Achieve and how to do so

- [ ] Content labels editable
    i guess i could make a function so that all labels are content editable, although that sounds cheap

    Does it make sense to have textareas and inputs instead of white boxes?

Maybe users could later edit those saved CS and save them...

- [ ] Save CS to DB


## MVP

- [ ] DB connection via NaturalCrit
- [ ] Styles preset.
- [ ] basic config features
    - [ ] Page size
    - [ ] Block columns*
- [ ] NavBar
- [ ] edit labels


### Other ideas
- Import content for the boxes
- Export as custom Json file
